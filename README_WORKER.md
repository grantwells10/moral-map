## **Instructions**

1. **Access the Website**:
   - Visit the (Moral Map website)[https://moral-map.onrender.com] hosted on Render.

2. **Review Instructions**:
   - Once you arrive on the website, you will be presented with an introduction to the platform along with the instructions on how to contribute. The key here is that once you begin the survey you will
     be asked to input information about your background, all of which is anonymous as there is no name field. Once you are finished with this, moving on will begin the survey.

3. **Answer Ethical Dilemmas**:
   - After submitting your background information, you will be presented with **10 dilemmas** selected randomly from our database.
   - Each dilemma will be shown **one at a time**. For each dilemma, read the question and select the response that best aligns with your perspective.

4. **Submit Your Responses**:
   - After responding to all 10 dilemmas, you will be prompted to **submit** your responses through the **Complete** button.
   - Note that none of your data will be recorded unless this button is pressed so make sure to complete the entire survey.

5. **Reach Out for Questions**:
   - If you encounter any issues or have questions about the process, feel free to email **Grant Wells** at:
     - Email: [gawells@seas.upenn.edu](mailto:gawells@seas.upenn.edu)
